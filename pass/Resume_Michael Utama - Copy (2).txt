“To amalgamate magic and reality, one analytical technique at a time”. I am a fervent believer in the 
seamless blending of the intrinsic prowess of data with an infinitesimal but paramount pinch of ‘gut-
feeling’ business instinct. In essence, I am a bit of FinTech, a bit of data geek, and a bit of a 
consulting junkie.
